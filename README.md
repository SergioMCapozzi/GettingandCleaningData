# GettingandCleaningData
Coursera Data Science Course

This repository includes the course project files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

These files include:
  <p>run_analysis.R = actual script for combining and cleaning the provided data</p>
  <p>tidydata.txt = the resulting txt file of the combinged, cleaned, and summarized data</p>
  <p>Codebook.md = a codebook that describes the variables, data, etc.</p>
  
This repository also includes the data folder, though my script assumes the data has been saved
to a local repository and the working directory in R Studio is pointed to the folder with this
data. Probably not the most elegant solution, but it's what I've got for now.
